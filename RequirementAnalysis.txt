############################################ Client Needs #############################################

The client is looking for a desktop application that can automate the room assignment process for
students at the start of each school year. The application will sort students accoridng to her manual
process :

- Matching roomate preferences
- Learning Living Prefered students
- Fill gaps with students who have floor & room preferences
- Fill remaining spots and waitlist spots with students who did not list preferences

The program should output the desired room plans in some kind of spread sheet or display that is easily 
read and can be copited for data entry. The client could also use the addition of sheets for Learning
Living waitlisted students and regular waitlisted students with housing contracts. 

############################################ Info We Need #############################################

After meeting with the client there are several data forms we need access to, the first is a detailed
form containing floor layouts for the dormatory. This will the number of rooms on each floor, room
numbers and how many students a room can accomidate. The second form is the exported excell sheet from 
e-living which contains the information needed for students who have recieved a housing contract and 
need to be assigned a room. As of now these are the three main documents we need and are currently in
the process of getting authorization to recieve these documnets from Mrs. Wescott.

############################################# Work-Flow ###############################################

The program should operate by taking input in the form of an exported excell spread sheet from the
e-living website. This spreadsheet will need to be parsed and a specified 'blocking' of the LionsGate
floors will generate which rooms are designated female/male based on contract numbers. Then some kind 
of algorithm will need to be applied to the data to replicate the manual process of sorting students
into appropraite rooms. This data will be display along with similar spreadsheets for more specific 
groups of students to create a waitlist queue.
